While acknowledging the importance of medication, they stress the holistic approach necessary for effective management, including therapy, support networks, and coping mechanisms. \nAdditionally, they confront the misconception that loved ones are powerless in supporting individuals with bipolar disorder. Tune in now to gain a deeper understanding of bipolar disorder and learn the truths versus the lies. \nTo learn more -- or read the transcript -- please visit the official episode page.\n“. . . And that is probably one of the most dangerous myths. And really, it has its claws into all of the other myths, that this is somehow simple. And I, I'm, I'm, I'm terrified that people believe it's simple, especially for our loved ones and for our people diagnosed with bipolar disorder. Because if they don't realize how complicated this is, and they don't realize how much work they need to do and how difficult this is going to be, then they might not be prepared for what's ahead.” ~Gabe Howard, Host\n\nOur host, Gabe Howard, is an award-winning writer and speaker who lives with bipolar disorder.
