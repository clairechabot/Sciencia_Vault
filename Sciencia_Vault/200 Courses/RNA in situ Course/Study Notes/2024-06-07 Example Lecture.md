# Notes 

- **RNA in situ hybridization** is a technique used to detect specific RNA sequences in tissue sections or cell preparations.
- **Probes**:
    - Typically labeled with fluorophores or radioactive isotopes.
    - Designed to complement the target RNA sequence.
- **Hybridization Conditions**:
    - Critical factors include temperature, buffer composition, and probe concentration.
    - Formamide is often used to reduce non-specific binding.
- Applications:
    - Gene expression studies.
    - Validation of RNA sequencing results.
    - Diagnosis of diseases at the molecular level.
- Challenges:
    - Non-specific binding leading to high background noise.
    - Sample preparation artifacts.
    - Probe stability during storage and use.


# To-do
