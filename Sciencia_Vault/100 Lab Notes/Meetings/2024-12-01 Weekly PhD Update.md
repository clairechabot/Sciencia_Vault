```ad-note
title: Meeting Summary

Reviewed progress on the RNA in situ protocol project, discussed challenges with buffer optimization, and set priorities for the upcoming week.
```

# Agenda
<br> 

- Discuss results from recent experiments on hybridization buffer optimization.
- Identify challenges and propose solutions for improving specificity and reproducibility.
- Plan experiments for the upcoming week.
- Address any administrative updates or resource needs.

<br> 

```ad-question

- Are the current buffer conditions sufficient for scaling up to high-throughput workflows? 
- What adjustments are needed to improve reproducibility in different sample types? 
- Do we need to allocate additional time or resources for probe design and validation?

```

# Notes
<br> 

- The 50% formamide buffer at pH 7.0 showed promising results but needs further testing across different RNA samples.
- Reproducibility issues were noted with smaller sample sizes; adjustments to sample preparation may be required.
- A detailed experiment plan for next week was drafted and will include testing alternative hybridization temperatures.
- Additional resources (pipette tips and reagents) were requested for ongoing experiments.
