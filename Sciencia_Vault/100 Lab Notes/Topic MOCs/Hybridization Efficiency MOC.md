Hybridization efficiency is influenced by buffer composition, temperature, and probe concentration, which are key parameters in RNA in situ protocols.

```ad-example
title: Topic Overview
collapse: open

Hybridization efficiency refers to the ability of probes to specifically bind to their complementary RNA targets. This is influenced by factors such as:
- Buffer composition (e.g., formamide concentration, pH).
- Hybridization temperature (stringency).
- Probe design (sequence specificity and GC content).
- Sample preparation and tissue fixation.

Understanding these parameters is crucial to optimizing signal-to-noise ratio in RNA in situ experiments.

- What are the optimal conditions for hybridization across different RNA types? 
- How do variations in probe length and labeling affect hybridization efficiency? 
- Can alternative buffers improve specificity without compromising signal intensity?
