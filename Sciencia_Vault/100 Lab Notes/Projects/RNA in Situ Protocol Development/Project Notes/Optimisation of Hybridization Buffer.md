_A very basic note to jot down ideas relevant to the project._


```ad-summary
title: Summary

Testing different hybridization buffer conditions to improve the clarity and reliability of RNA in situ results.
```



# Notes

- Testing various concentrations of formamide to improve specificity in RNA hybridization.
- Adjusting pH levels to minimize background noise while retaining signal intensity.
- Comparing buffer recipes against control experiments.
