# Sciencia Vault

Welcome to the **Sciencia Vault**! This vault is designed to support anyone navigating the challenges the life sciences, whether you're pursuing a graduate degree, a junior scientist, or managing multiple academic projects. With its structured layout and focus on efficient note-taking and project organization, this vault will help you stay on top of your coursework, research, and professional goals.

[!["Buy Me A Coffee"](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/assets/img/custom_images/orange_img.png)](https://buymeacoffee.com/cchabot)

## What's Inside?

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2a0a1339-5b28-4ada-b8e8-9f0434079607)

This is my first coding project, and itâ€™s taken me about a year to create and test this system (a heartfelt thanks to my colleagues who tested early versions!). Along the way, I refined it into a model that saves time, boosts productivity in the lab, and reduces the headache of organization in the long run.

The core idea of this vault is that a little effort goes a long way. Every day, there are tasks to add, update, and planâ€”activities that are unavoidable in research. I wanted to create something that makes those day-to-day functions easier and more intuitive: a central hub where all the information is connected and accessible. The beauty of this system is that the more you build into it, the greater the payback.

Using the Zettelkasten method, Iâ€™ve transformed how I research papers, remember references, and maintain a repository of sentences I can useâ€”already in my own voice and fully cited. Over time, this has become a web of interconnected ideas, papers, and notes, allowing me to retrieve critical information quickly without hours of searching. By integrating this system with a GPT API key, or even the free Smart Connections plugin, you can harness AI to uncover patterns and relationships within your work. This means:

- Finding connections between research paper notes (written in your own words and already cited).
- Avoiding lost meeting notes.
- Keeping track of contributions in collaborative projects.
- Creating hubs of information that naturally draw related insights together.
- Developing a personal assistant that grows alongside your research.

In short, this vault doesnâ€™t just store informationâ€”it actively helps you think, plan, and organize better.

## How This Vault Has Helped Me
So far, my own vault has helped me:
- Write abstracts for conference deadlines in record time.
- Keep track of tasks and key takeaways from meetings.
- Manage complex projects with many moving parts and collaborators.
- Apply insights from classes, seminars, and conferences directly to my lab work.
- Stay on top of small and large tasks that used to pile up and get forgotten.

For me, this system is an invaluable tool that Iâ€™m excited to continue developing throughout my Ph.D. It grows and evolves as my research does, becoming even more useful over time.

## How It Can Help You
Whether youâ€™re a graduate student, an junior project leader, or someone managing multiple projects, this vault can:

- Make research feel less overwhelming and more streamlined.
- Help you focus on the science instead of drowning in administrative details.
- Turn the small, day-to-day tasks into manageable and meaningful progress.
- Provide a stress-free way to stay organized and save time.

In short, this vault can take the pressure off, make research a little more fun, and help you unlock more of your creative and intellectual potential.

# Plugins

This is a list of plugins that I've integrated into the vault's structure. Some are more for aesthetics, and others are essential. Feel free to customize for your own personal use! 

- [Admonition](https://github.com/javalent/admonitions)   

- [Banners](https://github.com/noatpad/obsidian-banners)
  What I use to make the MOC's and homepage more aesthetically pleasing. If you don't like the banners, take out this plugin and delete them. 

- [Callout Manager](https://github.com/eth-p/obsidian-callout-manager)  

- [Completed Task Display](https://github.com/heliostatic/completed-task-display): Essential for the vault to function. Also very satisfying. 

- [Copilot](https://github.com/logancyang/obsidian-copilot): An AI Copilot in Obsidian. This is not essential, but if you build upon your vault with the zettelkasten method and your project notes, this can help with parsing information together that you've gathered over time. You do have to pay for an API key.  

- [Dataview](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview): Essential for the vault to function. 

- [Emoji Toolbar](https://github.com/oliveryh/obsidian-emoji-toolbar): Quickly search for and insert emojis into your notes.  

- [Highlightr](https://github.com/chetachiezikeuzor/Highlightr-Plugin)  

- [Homepage](https://github.com/mirnovov/obsidian-homepage): Open a specified note, canvas, or workspace on startup, or set it for quick access later. This is used for the "Ph.D. Dashboard". 

- [Iconize](https://github.com/FlorianWoelki/obsidian-iconize)

- [Janitor](https://github.com/Canna71/obsidian-janitor): Performs cleanup tasks on the Obsidian vault. Really helpful to know what orphan notes you might have or junk that's floating about.   

- [Linter](https://github.com/platers/obsidian-linter): Formats and styles your notes, including YAML tags, aliases, arrays, and metadata. I have some set-up in this vault already, but feel free to customize it. 

- [Meta Bind](https://github.com/mProjectsCode/obsidian-meta-bind-plugin): Essential if you like the buttons. I like the buttons. 

- [Minimal Theme Settings](https://github.com/kepano/obsidian-minimal-settings)

- [Multi Properties](https://github.com/technohiker/obsidian-multi-properties) 

- [Natural Language Dates](https://github.com/argenos/nldates-obsidian): Create date-links based on natural language. (i.e. write "today" or "next Friday" after you create a task and it will insert the correct date). 

- [Obsidian Columns](https://github.com/tnichols217/obsidian-columns)

- [Omnisearch](https://github.com/scambier/obsidian-omnisearch) : I believe this is essential to navigating your vault. At the moment, its better than the integrated obsidian vault search. I use it to look through my zettles and see what notes I have already and want to reference, or search through other documents in obsidian. 

- [Pandoc](https://github.com/OliverBalfour/obsidian-pandoc): This plugin helps you convert your pages in Obsidian to DOCX, ePub, and PDF. I find the PDF useful for the protocols I put in my vault when I want to print them out for the lab or share with others. 

- [PodNotes](https://github.com/chhoumann/PodNotes): This is useful if you like learning through podcasts and want to organise your notes from said podcasts into zettles later for referencing!

-  [Pomodoro](https://github.com/tokuhirom/obsidian-pomodoro-plugin): The pomodoro method helped me when I was writing my MSc. thesis, and having it integrated in the vault when I need to lock-in and work is really nice! Not necessary, but I find it useful. You can find an explanation of the technique on the plugin page.

-  [Quick Add](https://github.com/chhoumann/quickadd): Seemlessly add templates around your vault. 

-  [Smart Connections](https://github.com/brianpetro/obsidian-smart-connections): AI plugin to chat with your notes. 

-  [Style Settings](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-style-settings)

-  [Supercharged Links](https://github.com/mdelobelle/obsidian_supercharged_links) 

-  [Tasks](https://github.com/obsidian-tasks-group/obsidian-tasks): This one is necessary for how the vault is set-up, and also quite satisfying I might add.

-  [Templater](https://github.com/SilentVoid13/Templater): Another necessary plugin, this helps you integrate and call-up the custom templates within the vault.

-  [Time Stamper](https://github.com/Gru80/obsidian-timestamper): If you use this vault as a lab notebook, and need to stamp your experiment entries, then this plugin is very useful.

-  [Tracker](https://github.com/pyrochlore/obsidian-tracker): I used this to add small summaries of information around the vault (i.e. work hours called up from the daily notes).

-  [Widgets](https://github.com/rafaelveiga/obsidian-widgets): This was added for the clock on the homepage, as well as the quotes around the vault, but you can also add widgets for countdowns to deadlines on your homepage as well.

-  [Wordy](https://github.com/nqthqn/obsidian-wordy): Really helpful for when you're trying to write your original zettles or other notes within the vault.

-  [Zotero Integration](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-zotero-integration): Necessary if you want to easily integrate the zettlekasten system within your vault. See Artem Kirsanov's videos linked in the "Resources & Reference" section below to learn more.
